## What is assessPool?
Pooling individual samplesÂ before sequencing (pool-seq) can greatly reduce cost while producing allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), but can be difficult to analyze. assessPool is a user-friendly R pipeline designed to analyze population structure from pool-seq data. AsessPool accepts a variant-call format (VCF) file and a FASTA-formatted reference, providing a straightforward transition from commonly used pipelines such as Stacks or dDocent. AssessPool can handle a variable number of pools and uses Popoolation2 to generate locus-by- locus pairwise FST values and associated Fisher T-test values as measures of population structure, and generates visuals to aid in assessing relationships between pools as well as coverage-based trends.
